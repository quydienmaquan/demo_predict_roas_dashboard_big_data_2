This is a demo code for a ROAS prediction application for marketing campaigns. Please note the following:

The backend is running in a Google Colab environment. Upload the "BackEnd_API" (or "API") code file to Google Colab and upload the required dataset. Once executed, the backend will generate an API endpoint URL that connects to the frontend. Copy this API URL and paste it into the frontend to run the application (you may compress the frontend source code and upload it to V0.dev for execution).
